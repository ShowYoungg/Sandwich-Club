# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help better understand how it is processed.

## Demonstrated Competency
Through this project, I learnt:
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## How to run this app?
Download code to Android Studio and run project.
The app can also be built in Android Studio so it can be released for download on Android devices.
